#	Collision Dectection in UxAS using NASA's DAIDALUS code

This example is intended to informally test UxAS integration with NASA's DAIDALUS code.

This example simulate a patrol scenario that consists of three line searches.  One line search is performed around a polygon of intereset.  The other two line searches can be intepreted as surveilling two sides of a boundary.  This spacing, however, results in the UAV's tasked with performing these two line searches being on a collision course.   

## Input Files
* `cfgPatrol_1000.xml` - Configuration file for Entity 1000
* `cfgPatrol_2000.xml` - Configuration file for Entity 2000
* `cfgPatrol_4208.xml` - Configuration file for Entity 4208
* `Patrol.xml`	- AMASE configuration file for scenario
* `runUxAS_Patrol.sh` - script file that launches the scenario

## Running the Example
1. Open a terminal window in the directory `examples/12_Patrol`
2. Run the command `sh runUxAS_Patrol.sh`
3. Press play in AMASE after three additional terminals open displaying UxAS status messages for the three simulated vehicles.

## Notes
1. The vehicle configuration files may need to be edited to correctly identify the network device on line 9.
2. Three terminals will open and display to the screen debugging messages from DAIDALUS information.
3. The logged messages need to be interrogated in order to view UxAS messages sent from DAIDALUS information.
4. The current script file assumes the used of AMASE that includes a DAIDALUS plugin to diplay visualizations of the guidance processing bands generated by the DAIDALUS code.
	(Use DAIDALUS_Integration branch of the AMASE repository located at https://github.com/afrl-rq/OpenAMASE)
5. This is a work in progress and is subject to change.

## Things to try
1. Changing the configuration will change the way the vehicles respond to detections of projected loss of wellclear.
	-See DAIDALUS_WCV_Detection.h and DAIDALUS_WCV_Response.h to see the defaults and the changable parameters.
