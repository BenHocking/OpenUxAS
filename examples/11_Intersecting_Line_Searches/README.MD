#	Collision Dectection in UxAS using NASA's DAIDALUS code

This example is intended to informally test UxAS integration with NASA's DAIDALUS code.

To demonstrate this integration of DAIDALUS into UxAS a scenario was created that has three line searches that need to be fulfilled by three eligible entities.  During the course of conducting these line searches, the vehicle will violate each others wellclear volume unless preventative measures are taken. DAIDALUS provides detection of this loss of wellclear which is then actuated upon by a rule based response.

## Input Files
* `cfgIntersecting_1000.xml` - Configuration file for Entity 1000
* `cfgIntersecting_2000.xml` - Configuration file for Entity 2000
* `cfgIntersecting_4208.xml` - Configuration file for Entity 4208
* `Intersecting_Line_Search.xml` - AMASE configuration file for scenario
* `runUxAS_Intersecting_Line_Searchs.sh` - script file that launches the scenario

## Running the Example
1. Open a terminal window in the directory `examples/11_Intersecting_Line_Searches`
2. Run the command `sh runUxAS_Intersecting_Line_Searches.sh`
3. Press play in AMASE after three additional terminals open displaying UxAS status messages for the three simulated vehicles.

## Notes
1. The vehicle configuration files may need to be edited to correctly identify the network device on line 9.
2. Three terminals will open and display to the screen debugging messages from DAIDALUS information.
3. The logged messages need to be interrogated in order to view UxAS messages sent from DAIDALUS information.
4. The current script file assumes the used of AMASE that includes a DAIDALUS plugin to diplay visualizations of the guidance processing bands generated by the DAIDALUS code.
	(Use daidalus branch of the AMASE repository located at https://github.com/afrl-rq/OpenAMASE)
5. This is a work in progress and is subject to change.

## Things to try
1. Changing the configuration will change the way the vehicles respond to detections of projected loss of wellclear.
	-See DAIDALUS_WCV_Detection.h and DAIDALUS_WCV_Response.h to see the defaults and the changable parameters.
